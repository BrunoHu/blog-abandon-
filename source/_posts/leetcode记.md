This is a personal answers of leetcode problem. My aim is to find the fast way to solve the problems by python. In some cases, the time or space complexity may be sacrificed. All the problems sorted by AC rate.

# No.292 [Nim game](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/)

> You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

The introduction leaks the most important hint that if there are 4 stones left and you are the first, you will never win. So, our aim is to let the opponent to face this situation. Obviously, if you are the first and can not make the number of left stones as 4n, you must lose. This is a math problem and code is nonsence.

```

Basic algorithm problem. Recursion is the simplist solution.

# No.237 [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

> Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

> Supposed the linked list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become `1 -> 2 -> 4` after calling your function.

Unlike normal link node problems, the head node is unavailable. So we can not solve the front node's next link. But this problem does not limit the node value such that we can replace the value of node by next node as a bypass solution.

```
class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """

# No.283 [Move Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

> Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

> For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

A simple solution is obvious and speed is not the best in this solution.

```
class Solution(object):
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        """

        for i in range(n):
            nums.remove(0)
        nums.extend([0]*n)
```
The normal fast way is use two pointers. One points and one points last to find non-zero position to switch.

# No.100 [Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

> Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.

> Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

# No.260 [Single Number 3](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

> Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

> For example:

> Given `nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]`, return `[3, 5]`.

A common way is establish a dict to count so that the time complexity could be liinear runtime. But obviously the number set is big and the space sonsumption is not good. Anyway, it is fast solution~

```
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):

        for i in nums:

        result = []
        for i in d:

# No.238 [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

> Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

> Solve it **without division** and in O(n).

> For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].

In this problem, we could only use multiply operation. A concise and common idea is establsh two support list. One of them save the left result of multiplying and another save the right. For example, the original list is `[1,2,3,4]` so the left multiplying result is [1,1,2,6] and the right is [24,12,4,1]. The time complexity is O(n) of these operation. Next procedure is obvious. Just do vector multiply and get the result.

```
class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]

        length = len(nums)
        left = [1]*length
        right = [1]*length
        for i in range(1,length):
            left[i] = left[i-1]*nums[i-1]
        for i in range(1,length):
            right[length-i-1] = right[length-i]*nums[length-i]
        result = [x*y for x,y in zip(left,right)]
        return result
```

Using python power inside function is a concise solution.

# No.217 [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

Iterable version is also simple structure of stack. Postorder one will be a little difficult which given below.

# No.145 [Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

> Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Now the last one of basic binary tree series. Unlike the former recursion solution, following is Iterable one.

In postorder, simple stack structure can not work, so we need to add a flag to represent whether the child nodes in stack. Suppose `False` flag means child node had enter in stack and `True` flag is opposite.

Obviously, if we have the flag, once we pop a node from stack, if flag is `True`, we can push it back and set False, and then push its left and right child node with True. Do it loop and problem solved.

```

We could use inorder search to get the kth number. The follwing is a Iterable solution using stack. Recursion is also a typical way.

There is a very tricky way to solve the problem without loop or recursion. We must face the fact that the problem is in computer rather than in math. The biggest number which is the power of 3 is specific. so if `biggest_3_power % target == 0`, then the target number is the ture answer.
